# Code Quiz App

## Description
This app meant to be created in order to test HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web API skills all at once. It was supposed to use local storage to 
store scores from the quiz. I learned that with enough trial and error you can get some things to work but what I should have done was ask for 
help. A second set of eyes from someone more experienced would have been good.

## Usage
Click the start button to start the timer and answer the questions. Add initials at the end to save into your local storage.
Click the View High Scores button to view your past, saved scores.
